- 👋 ╰(*°▽°*)╯ Hi! I'm Jason (aka deladroid).  I'm a software developer and digital marketing experienced hooman🧑🏽 of about 20 years.  I started in visual basic and asp classic, then moved on to asp/vb.net, and eventually falling into C#.  
 
- 👀 I’m interested in not re-inventing the wheel, but bringing innovation to update the wheel, or create a new wheel. (Apps, I'm talking about apps 😛).
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and researching what is popular and new, as well as problems needing solutions.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that answers a problem, and possibly creates new questions creating opportunity.

- 📫 You can reach me here on 🧑🏽‍💻 Github as "@deladroid", or 🐔 Twitter as "@delacombo".
